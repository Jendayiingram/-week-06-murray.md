Response: Murray provides a good example of how television and the internet are beginning to form as one. The example of college students multitasking is such a revenant observation that currently happening. Claiming that were able to write a paper while watching the TV. Another observation was the video "Why 'The Mandalorian' Uses Virtual Sets Over Green Screen". When making this film, I  found it interesting how technology has become so developed. In this film, rather than using a green screen, the team decided to use a large LED screen where you can just control its perspective viewpoint. Combining gaming effects with film effects. Overall, Murray's predictions about internet television and inhabiting virtual environments were successful because you're seeing them applied to everyday things.
